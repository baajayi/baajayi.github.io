        <h2>Do you now about the Felipe Xicotencatl?</h2>
        <p>USS Scuffle (AM-298) was an Admirable-class minesweeper built for the United States Navy during World War II. She was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation and five battle stars for service in the Pacific during World War II. She was decommissioned in June 1946 and placed in reserve. While remaining in reserve, Scuffle was reclassified as MSF-298 in February 1955, but never reactivated. In October 1962, she was sold to the Mexican Navy and renamed ARM DM-05. In 1994, she was renamed ARM General Felipe Xicoténcatl (C53). She was sunk as an artificial reef and dive attraction off of Cozumel in 1999, and was stricken from the rolls of the Mexican Navy in 2000... <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Scuffle_(AM-298)">continue reading</a> <br>
        You can see the remains when you do the Atlantis Submarine.</p>

   <div> <h2>Punta Sur Ecological Garden</h2>
<p>Punta Sur Eco Beach is the best beach on the Island, and a visit to this eco-park is definitely one of the top things to do in Cozumel. This area is located on the south of the island and covers an area of 2,500 acres.

    Here you’ll find exotic birds, crocodiles, sea turtles, beautiful flowers and beautiful beaches – the perfect place for nature lovers.
    
    If you don’t feel like snorkelling the reef or visiting the lighthouse (see below), you can just hang out on hammocks and enjoy the sun.</p></div>
<div><h2>Playa Mia</h2>
<p>If you’re looking to visit a beach park during your trip to Cozumel, consider Playa Mia Grand Beach Park, an ethical adventure park. While there are many “marine parks” that may sound great, Goats On The Road doesn’t recommend visiting them due to the captivity of wild animals. 

    Check out Playa Mia Grand Beach Park instead.
    
    Here, you’ll have use of snorkels, waterslides, pools, kayaks, hobie cats, paddle boats, volleyball courts and more. This park doesn’t have any animals in captivity, which is why we recommend it.</p></div>
   <div><h2>Sea Trek</h2>
<p>A unique way of experiencing the underwater world is by trying helmet diving with Seatrek. The fully enclosed helmet sits neatly on your shoulders and a steady stream of air assists you in breathing.

    If you wear prescription glasses, no problem, you can still wear them in the helmet as you walk along the bottom of the ocean at around 20 – 25 feet.</p></div>
   <div ><h2>Alantis Submarine</h2>
<p class="submarine">If you do the Atlantis Submarine, you will visit the Felipe Xicotencatl wreck that sank in the year 2000 plus colourful schools of fish, sharks, turtles, stingrays and lobsters. For more information and the latest prices.
</p></div>
   <div><h2>Private Jeep Snorkeling</h2>
<p>One of the best activities to do in Cozumel is a private Jeep Tour with lunch and the opportunity to go snorkelling. The tour comes with your own private guide which means that he knows the best-secluded beaches to go snorkelling and swimming without the crowds.
    The best part about this Cozumel excursion is that it’s completely customizable. Let your guide know ahead of time what you’re interested in seeing in Cozumel and he’ll put together an itinerary to suit your needs. 

Apart from private transportation, snorkelling, tequila tasting, Mexican lunch, and a margarita (or two) are included in the trip.

   <div><h2>Mayan Ruins</h2>
    <img class="mayaruins" src="./images/ruins.jpg" alt="A Mayan Ruin">
<p class="maya">Did you know that there are Mayan ruins on Cozumel? Located on the northern part of Cozumel, tucked away in the undeveloped jungle, you’ll find the San Gervasio archaeological site (the pre-Hispanic name was Tantun Cuzamil).Sure, these ruins aren’t as large or impressive as Chichen Itza or Tulum ruins, but they are unique in their own way. This is one of the more off-track things to do in Cozumel, and is a great day trip.
